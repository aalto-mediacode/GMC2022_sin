Create shapes by using sin function. You can change the range and size as well as color of the circles. I tried to make a version of this where instead of circles there would be an uploaded image repeating but the images wouldn't load properly (they had some pixels showing first and then the images turned grey) even though it worked otherwise. So I assume the program couldn't draw the image files fast enough? Maybe it would have to be optimized somehow but I didn't know how so I made it only with the circles.

I also wanted that the center point would not move but this I didn't know how to do this. We tried to change the sin function so that the i value in the for loop would affect the size in a way that it would increase with time but it wouldn't work. Other way that was suggested was mapping the values to increase/decrease the maximum and minimum but this I couldn't figure out either.
