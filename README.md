Create shapes by using sin function. You can change the range and size as well as color of the circles. I tried to make a version of this where instead of circles there would be an uploaded image repeating but the images wouldn't load properly (they had some pixels showing first and then the images turned grey) even though it worked otherwise. So I assume the program couldn't draw the image files fast enough? Maybe it would have to be optimized somehow but I didn't know how so I submitted it only with the circles.
